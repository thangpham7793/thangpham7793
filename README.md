- 👋 Hi, I’m Thang
- 👀 I’m interested in Domain Driven Design and Functional Programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir & Phoenix.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that solve real problems, even if it's just you experiencing it!
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best (thangnus@gmail.com), but hit me up if you're based in Auckland, NZ!
